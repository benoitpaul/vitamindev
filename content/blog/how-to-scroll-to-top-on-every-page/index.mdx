When your application routes back to a previous page, the browser might _remember_ the scroll position it was in. So you might be position at the bottom of the screen, instead of the top/

If you want to make sure to scroll to the top of the page when your application routes back to a previous page, you can set this behavior with the [`config` parameter of RouterModule.forRoot() method](https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions).

```typescript
RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {
  scrollOffset: [0, 0],
  scrollPositionRestoration: 'top',
});
```
