You might encounter the following error after running `git pull`:

```bash
error: cannot stat 'path/file': Permission denied
```

The error is probably because an editor or a terminal locking the file.

To fix the `cannot stat` error, **you need to close the editor and terminal**. Running `git pull` again will work fine after that.
