You can use JavaScript to manipulate the styling of elements. Changing the visibility, transforming the element, etc.

Sometimes you need to debug styling on a site that has many JavaScript files included. How can you find that particular line of code?

**You need to instruct Google Chrome to pause the debugger when the CSS properties change**.

### Locate the element to inspect

Open the Elements panel and locate the element you want to inspect.

### Break on attribute modifications

Right-click on the element. From the context menu, choose Break on > attribute modifications.
