In angular, the host element is a concept that can be applied to directives or components.

## Directive

The host element of a directive is the element the directive is attached to.

```markup
<p my-directive>text<p>
```

In the example above, the `<p>` element is the host element of the `my-directive` directive.

Component

The host element of a component is the selector element of the component.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-test',
  templateUrl: './test.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./test.component.css'],
})
export class TestComponent {
  constructor() {}
}
```

```markup
<app-test></app-test>
```

In the example above, the `<app-test>` element is the host element.
