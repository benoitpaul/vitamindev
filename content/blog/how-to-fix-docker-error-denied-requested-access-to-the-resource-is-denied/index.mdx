If you try to push your Docker image to DockerHub, you may encounter this error:  
`denied: requested access to the resource is denied`

It's that's the case you probably just need to log in to docker before pushing the image:

```bash
docker login
docker build -t YOUR_DOCKER_NAME/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE .
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_NAME/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
```
